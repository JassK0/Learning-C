Answer file: ans9.c

Given file que9.c is supposed to create 2 line segments and print
the length of each, where a line segment is represented by its two 
endpoints. The program should produce the output below.

However, the program is missing some code, denoted by XXXXXXX.
Copy que9.c to ans9.c and complete ans9.c by replacing only XXXXXXX. 
so that the program functions as required.

> gcc ans9.c -lm
> ./a.out
Line from (0,-1) to (1,0) has length 1.41.
Line from (2,1) to (5,7) has length 6.71.
