sed 's/old/new/g'

dont need s if your not relacing

dont need g if only want to look at first thing in line

sed -i to directly edit  file in place

When s/? Is Not Needed
If you're performing other sed operations (not substitutions), you donâ€™t need s/?.
 For example:

Deleting lines:
sed '3d' filename
Deletes line 3.

Printing specific lines:
sed -n '2p' filename
Prints only line 2.

Inserting or appending text:
sed '2i\New Line' filename
Inserts "New Line" before line 2.
